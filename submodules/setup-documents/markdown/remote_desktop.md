## Remote Desktop Client 

In this workshop we will be using remote desktops that come pre-configured with all the
resources you will need to complete the course. Prior to that you will need to download
the windows remote desktop client suitable for your operating system.

The remote desktop will be available to you for the time allocated to your workshop 
and potentially include some 'out of hours' time.

During the course we will have time dedicated to helping you install the software on 
your own computer so afterwards you can continue to use the skills you have learnt.

Note: the Virtual computers will automatically start before the workshop and stop at the end. 
If you are inactive for more than 15 minutes, they will also switch off. They can be re-started from the Lab Services Tab
but this can take up to 5 minutes, and you may need to ask the instructor. Outside the sessions if you have been
allocated additional time you may log in to your session and continue working.
