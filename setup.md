# Setup for Lesson
## GitHub ##
We'll be using the website [GitHub](https://github.com/) to host, back up, and distribute our code. You'll need to [create an account there](https://github.com/signup). As your GitHub username will appear in the URLs of your projects there, it's best to use a short, clear version of your name if you can.

## Project Demo Repository

We'll be showing you how to manage an example academic software project. 
If you've completed our **Version Control with git** workshop, you'll have a finished version of our `climate-analysis` repository ([you'll have used the template from here](https://github.com/Southampton-RSG-Training/git-novice-template/))
If not, please [create a copy of it from this template (linked here)](https://github.com/Southampton-RSG-Training/project-novice-template/generate), and name it `climate-analysis`.

## Install Visual Studio Code

This workshop involves editing code files. 
Whilst you can use any text editor to do this, some code editors or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) have features designed to make coding easier.
If you're already using a code editor or IDE (e.g. [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)), 
stick with what you're comfortable with. If not, we'd recommend installing [Visual Studio Code (link here)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Windows / MacOS
Go to [the Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and download and run the installer.

### Linux
If you're on **Ubuntu**, Visual Studio Code should be available through the software centre! 
If not, [follow the detailed instructions here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux) to install it.
