## 0. Introduction


### Before We Start

- Make sure you have an account at [github.com](https://www.github.com)
- Go to, or make, a `climate-analysis` repo
- Open VS Code or a text editor
- e.g. Atom, Sublime Text, Notepad++, BBEdit


## 1. What Is Academic Software?


### The Large

- Database creation & management
- HPC simulation codes
- Machine learning pipelines
- Firmware & drivers


### The Small

- Collections of scripts
- Cleaning data
- Plotting figures
- Toy models


### The Commonalities

- May not be true for Engineering/CompSci!
- *Instrumental* - not a goal in itself
- *Experimental* - may not have a clear spec
- Small teams


### The Issues

- **Paperware**
- Unplanned
- Undocumented
- Unmaintainable
- Can't onboard people
- Disposable


### The Outcomes

- Software Is Science
- Reproducibility
- Wasted effort
- Harms collaboration
- Knowledge decay
- Bus Factor!


## 2. How Do We Avoid This


### Sustainable Software

- Clearly plan what you can
- Assume others will read your code
- Document your *development process*
- Document your code's limitations
- Track and cite specific versions
